# cab-id

This Chrome extension will show the 'cab-id' for any page on the Citizens Advice website. It's used by content designers working on EPiServer to quickly locate the 'cab-id' when they're making new internal links.

## Known issues

This extension has now been removed from the Chrome Extension store. It's because it's using an old manifest version. It needs to be updated to version 3 but the documentation on how to do this is unclear. https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/
